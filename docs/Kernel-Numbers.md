## BoxedFloat64

My instances hold 64-bit Floats in heap objects. This is the only representation on 32-bit systems. But on 64-bit systems SmallFloat64 holds a subset of the full 64-bit double-precision range in immediate objects.

## Float

A note About Floating Point numbers and Floating Point Arithmetic. The following is not specific to Cuis or Smalltalk at all. This is about the properties of Float numbers in any computer implementation. If you haven't done so already, read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic But if you find the Wikipedia article too detailed, or hard to read, then try http://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/ (get past "How Floating Point are usually explained" and read "A different way to explain..."). Other great reads are: "Why don't my numbers add up?": http://floating-point-gui.de/ and "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic": http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html and also maybe "Comparing floating point numbers" https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/ Now that you read them, and we are on the same boat, some further comments (from jmv): Floats are (conceptually) approximate real numbers. That's why trig and other trascendental functions always answer Floats. That's why it is ok to round the result of operations. That's why Float is considered more general than Fraction in ST-80 and most Smalltalks. So, when we have a Float value, we must not think about it as a Rational but as a Real (actually as some unknown Real that could hopefully be close to the Rational we can actually represent). Keep this in mind when dealing with Floats, and especially avoid comparing them for equality. When doing mixed operations with Floats and Fractions, Cuis, as most other Smalltalks, converts all values to Floats. Some other systems, including Pharo Smalltalk, Scheme and Lisp have two rules: when the answer is a Number, they convert to Float. But when the answer is a boolean (#<, #=, #<=, etc.) they convert to Fraction. We think this is a mistake. There should never be implicit conversions from Float to Fraction. Fractions are to hold exact values, and people expect Fractions to be exact. On the other hand, Floats are to hold approximations (and people should be aware of that!). But an implicit conversion from Float to Fraction would give a Fraction that should not be considered an exact value (the value comes from an inexact Float), but that knowledge is lost, as it is an instance of Fraction. If you want exact arithmetic, usual mathematical properties (like transitivity of equality), can live in the limited world of Rational numbers, and can afford a slight performance penalty, use Fraction instead. Avoid trascendental functions and never convert to Float. In any case, most numeric computation is done on Float numbers. There are good reasons for that. One is that in most cases we don't need an exact answer. And in many cases we can't really have it: the inputs to algorithms already have a limited precision, or they use trascendental functions. And even when exact arithmetic possible, if we are doing sound synthesis, 24 bits of resolution is enough. For image processing and graphics, the result is never more than 16 bits per channel. So, these fields don't really need 64 bit Doubles. 32 bit Floats are enough. Other fields do need 64 bit Doubles, like physics simulations and geometry. Games usually prefer special, faster 32 bit Float operations in GPUs that have greater errors but are faster. There are some things that can be done to increase the confidence you can have on Float results. One is to do an error propagation analysis on the code you are running. This is not easy, but it is done for any widely used numerical method. Then, you can know real bounds and/or estimates of the errors made. So, understanding your inputs and your algorithms (for example error propagation, condition number, numeric stability), and using Float number if appropriate, is the usual advice. Perhaps you have heard about "interval arithmetic". It is a bit better than simple Float, but doesn't really fix the problems. The ultimate solution is to do Monte Carlo analysis, with random perturbation of inputs. After the Monte Carlo run, it is needed to do statistical analysis of possible correlations between the distributions of the random noise added to imputs and the result of the algorithm. Additional food for thought: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Mindless.pdf . According to this, doing Monte Carlo as described above attacks a slightly different problem. This might be yet another reason (besides performance) to try something like the next paragraph. I (jmv) came up with it, and I don't really know if it has been described and or tried before or not. Mhhh. Maybe a defensive publication is in order. A possibility that could be a practical solution, being much cheaper than Monte Carlo, but better than interval arithmetic, is to represent each value by 2 Floats: an estimation of the real value (i.e. an estimation of the mean value of the distribution of the corresponding Monte Carlo result), and an estimation of the error (i.e. an estimation of the standard deviation of the corresponding Monte Carlo result). Or perhaps even 3 of them. In addition to the estimation of the real value and an estimation of the error, we could add a hard bound on the error. In many cases it will be useless, because the error can not really be bound. But in those cases where it is possible to bound it, applications could really know about the quality of computed values. ======================================================================= My instances represent IEEE 754 floating-point double-precision numbers. They have about 16 decimal digits of accuracy and their range is between plus and minus 10^307. Some valid examples are: 8.0 13.3 0.3 2.5e6 1.27e-30 1.27e-31 -12.987654e12 Mainly: no embedded blanks, little e for tens power, and a digit on both sides of the decimal point. It is actually possible to specify a radix for Float constants. This is great for teaching about numbers, but may be confusing to the average reader: 3r20.2 --> 6.66666666666667 8r20.2 --> 16.25 If you don't have access to the definition of IEEE754, you can figure out what is going on by printing various simple values in Float hex. It may help you to know that the basic format is... sign 1 bit exponent 11 bits with bias of 1023 (16r3FF), substracted to produce an actual exponent in the range -1022 .. +1023 - 16r000: significand = 0: Float zero significand ~= 0: Denormal number (actual exponent is -1022, not -1023. No implicit leading '1' bit in mantissa) - 16r7FF: significand = 0: Infinity significand ~= 0: Not A Number (NaN) representation mantissa 53 bits, but only 52 are stored (20 in the first word, 32 in the second). This is because a normalized mantissa, by definition, has a 1 to the right of its floating point, and IEEE 754 omits this redundant bit to gain an extra bit of precision instead. People talk about the mantissa without its leading one as the FRACTION, and with its leading 1 as the SIGNFICAND. The single-precision format is... sign 1 bit exponent 8 bits with bias of 127 (16r7F, substracted to produce an actual exponent in the range -126 .. +127 - 16r00: significand = 0: Float zero significand ~= 0: Denormal number (actual exponent is -126, not -127. No implicit leading '1' bit in mantissa) - 16rFF: significand = 0: Infinity significand ~= 0: Not A Number (NaN) representation mantissa 24 bits, but only 23 are stored This format is used in FloatArray (qv), and much can be learned from the conversion routines, Float asIEEE32BitWord, and Float class fromIEEE32Bit:. You might also check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754_revision Other great reads (covering broader but interesting issues): https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/floating-point-determinism/ http://www.ima.umn.edu/2010-2011/W1.10-14.11/activities/Leeser-Miriam/Leeser-GPU-IMA-Jan2011.pdf

## Fraction

Fraction provides methods for dealing with fractions like 1/3 as fractions (not as 0.33333...). All public arithmetic operations answer reduced fractions (see examples). instance variables: 'numerator denominator ' Examples: (note the parentheses required to get the right answers in Smalltalk): (2/3) + (2/3) (2/3) + (1/2) "answers shows the reduced fraction" (2/3) raisedToInteger: 5 "fractions also can have exponents"

## Integer

I am a common abstract superclass for all Integer implementations. My implementation subclasses are SmallInteger, LargePositiveInteger, and LargeNegativeInteger. Integer division consists of: / exact division, answers a fraction if result is not a whole integer // answers an Integer, rounded towards negative infinity \\ is modulo rounded towards negative infinity quo: truncated division, rounded towards zero

## LargePositiveInteger

I represent positive integers of more than 30 bits (ie, >= 1073741824). These values are beyond the range of SmallInteger, and are encoded here as an array of 8-bit digits. Care must be taken, when new values are computed, that any result that COULD BE a SmallInteger IS a SmallInteger (see normalize). Note that the bit manipulation primitives, bitAnd:, bitShift:, etc., = and ~= run without failure (and therefore fast) if the value fits in 32 bits. This is a great help to the simulator.

### Methods
#### LargePositiveInteger>>#highBit

Answer the position of the leading bit or zero if the receiver is zero. Raise an error if the receiver is negative, since negative integers are defined to have an infinite number of leading 1's in 2's-complement arithmetic.

In base 16, a square number can end only with 0,1,4 or 9 and - in case 0, only 0,1,4,9 can precede it, - in case 4, only even numbers can precede it. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number So, in hex, the last byte must be one of: 00 10 40 90 x1 e4 x9 where x is any hex digit and e is any even digit Also, the receiver must be an aven power of two. This needs additional testing in the 00 suffix, as it implied in all the other conditions

	"Answer a Float that best approximates the value of the receiver.
	This algorithm is optimized to process only the significant digits of a LargeInteger.
	And it does honour IEEE 754 round to nearest even mode in case of excess precision (see details below)."
	
	"How numbers are rounded in IEEE 754 default rounding mode:
	A shift is applied so that the highest 53 bits are placed before the floating point to form a mantissa.
	The trailing bits form the fraction part placed after the floating point.
	This fractional number must be rounded to the nearest integer.
	If fraction part is 2r0.1, exactly between two consecutive integers, there is a tie.
	The nearest even integer is chosen in this case.
	Examples (First 52bits of mantissa are omitted for brevity):
	2r0.00001 is rounded downward to 2r0
	2r1.00001 is rounded downward to 2r1
	2r0.1 is a tie and rounded to 2r0 (nearest even)
	2r1.1 is a tie and rounded to 2r10 (nearest even)
	2r0.10001 is rounded upward to 2r1
	2r1.10001 is rounded upward to 2r10
	Thus, if the next bit after floating point is 0, the mantissa is left unchanged.
	If next bit after floating point is 1, an odd mantissa is always rounded upper.
	An even mantissa is rounded upper only if the fraction part is not a tie."
	
	"Algorihm details:
	Floating point hardware will correctly handle the rounding by itself with a single inexact operation if mantissa has one excess bit of precision.
	Except in the last case when extra bits are present after an even mantissa, we must round upper by ourselves.
	Note 1: the inexact flag in floating point hardware must not be trusted because it won't take into account the bits we truncated by ourselves.
	Note 2: the floating point hardware is presumed configured in default rounding mode."

## Number

Class Number holds the most general methods for dealing with numbers. Subclasses Float, Fraction, and Integer, and their subclasses, provide concrete representations of a numeric quantity. All of Number's subclasses participate in a simple type coercion mechanism that supports mixed-mode arithmetic and comparisons. It works as follows: If self<typeA> op: arg<typeB> fails because of incompatible types, then it is retried in the following guise: (arg adaptTypeA: self) op: arg adaptToTypeA. This gives the arg of typeB an opportunity to resolve the incompatibility, knowing exactly what two types are involved. If self is more general, then arg will be converted, and viceVersa. This mechanism is extensible to any new number classes that one might wish to add to Squeak. The only requirement is that every subclass of Number must support a pair of conversion methods specific to each of the other subclasses of Number. Note: To write an hex number, in Cuis you can do 16rFE and not 16rfe. WRT some proposal to change this, Dan Ingalls said: at http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/2000-March/013368.html : I will have to admit to a bit of bigotry here. I was the originator of the numeric format, and I object to a couple of the ANSI decisions regarding the syntax of numeric constants. I have three reasons for this... 1. I much prefer 2r1e31 to 2r10000000000000000000000000000000 for the sign bit and 16rFe8 for the high nibble of a 32-bit integer and 10e6 for a million. Come on. (jmv note: it is actually 16rFe7 hex and 10e5) 2. I just feel that the current (Squeak) def, which is the original one, is a micro world of simplicity and generality. Radix, digits and exponent defined analogously over ints, largeInts, and Floats. That's all. 3. I have spent entire hours with inquisitive kids, just exploring this micro world. If they get bored with 2r1e10 then it's time to step out and explore the meaning of 3r11.2. If I were going to "fix" anything, I think it would be to allow 1r111111111111 = 12. This may be the issue that finally leads to a parting of the ways in the Squeak Community. Just Kidding - Dan Note: Cuis does support the Unary numeric system. So 1r111111111111 = 12 1r1 = 1 1r11 = 2 1r-11 = -2 1r111 = 3 1r = 0 See See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system and #readBaseOneFrom:

## ParkMiller88Random

This Random Number Generator graciously contributed by David N. Smith. It is an adaptation of the Park-Miller RNG which uses Floats to avoid the need for LargeInteger arithmetic. The algorithm is described in detail in Random Number Generators: Good Ones Are Hard To Find Stephen K. Park, Keith W. Miller (Communications of the ACM, 31(10):1192--1201, 1988) http://www.firstpr.com.au/dsp/rand31/p1192-park.pdf See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_random_number_generator.

## SmallInteger

My instances are 31-bit numbers, stored in twos complement form. The allowable range is approximately +- 1 billion (see SmallInteger minVal, maxVal). Of the various classes in the Number hierarchy, SmallInteger gives: - Maximum performance - Top precision - Restricted possible values LargePositive(Negative)Integer and Fraction give increasing generality (more possible values) at the expense of performance. Float gives more generality at the expense of precision. Please see the class comments of the other Number classes.
