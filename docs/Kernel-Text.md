## Character

I represent a character by storing its associated Latin-9 code (ISO 8859-15). My instances are created uniquely, so that all instances of a character ($R, for example) are identical.

### Methods

#### Character>>#is: aSymbol

A means for cleanly replacing isXXX like methods. Please use judiciously! aSymbol is ussually a class name (starting with uppercase) or a protocolo conformance question (starting with lowercase), such as #hasTextSelector, #hasTextProvider, etc. A few comments: - Good for kernel tests - Good for tests defined in the same package as the receiver - Overwriting this method in a different package is a bad idea. It will surely conflict with other package. Use the traditional isXXX in such cases - In any case, asking these kinds of questions is a sign of poor design. If possible, avoid the question altogether, using, for example, double dispatching. - if a class happens to answer true for several Symbols, consider implementing it like: ^#(symbol1 symbol2 symbol3) statePointsTo: aSymbol

#### Character>>#asString

Answer a string that represents the receiver. Don't include extra quotes for Strings. This message has may uses. Some of them call it to convert numbers to a string, and/or can be converted back to number. Other uses are for the UI. Some need conversion from ByteArray (where the result is not a description of the ByteArray, the same contents in a different class). Others need conversion from Text. Or from Character or Symbol. In many cases, the receiver might sometimes be a String (and the same String is desired). It would be great to check every sender and change them for a message with a more specific meaning. Maybe some day. In addition this message is used by code that also runs in other Smalltalks, and removing it would affect portability. In any case, in your code, if possible, use a more specific method. See the comments at: #printString #displayStringOrText #asString #storeString

## String

A String is an indexed collection of Characters. In Cuis, Characters are represented in the Latin-9 (ISO 8859-15) encoding. Each character takes 1 byte. String support a vast array of useful methods, which can best be learned by browsing and trying out examples as you find them in the code. Here are a few useful methods to look at... String match: String contractTo: String also inherits many useful methods from its hierarchy, such as SequenceableCollection , SequenceableCollection copyReplaceAll:with: Cuis includes limited support for Unicode. A ByteArray can hold any Unicode string in utf-8. There is support for converting to and from instances of String. As String can not hold all Unicode code points, (just the ISO 8859-15 subset), others are converted to NCRs. See #fromUtf8:hex:trimLastNull: and #asUtf8: .

#### Symbol>>#flushCache

Tell the interpreter to remove all entries with this symbol as a selector from its method lookup cache, if it has one. This primitive must be called whenever a method is defined or removed. NOTE: Only one of the two selective flush methods needs to be used. Squeak 2.3 and later uses 116 (See CompiledMethod flushCache).

#### Symbol>>#species

Answer the preferred class for reconstructing the receiver. For example, collections create new collections whenever enumeration messages such as collect: or select: are invoked. The new kind of collection is determined by the species of the original collection. Species and class are not always the same. For example, the species of Interval is Array.
