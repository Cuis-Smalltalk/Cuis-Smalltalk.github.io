#### CodeProvider>>#is: aSymbol

A means for cleanly replacing isXXX like methods. Please use judiciously! aSymbol is ussually a class name (starting with uppercase) or a protocolo conformance question (starting with lowercase), such as #hasTextSelector, #hasTextProvider, etc. A few comments: - Good for kernel tests - Good for tests defined in the same package as the receiver - Overwriting this method in a different package is a bad idea. It will surely conflict with other package. Use the traditional isXXX in such cases - In any case, asking these kinds of questions is a sign of poor design. If possible, avoid the question altogether, using, for example, double dispatching. - if a class happens to answer true for several Symbols, consider implementing it like: ^#(symbol1 symbol2 symbol3) statePointsTo: aSymbol

#### PluggableTextModel>>#is: aSymbol

A means for cleanly replacing isXXX like methods. Please use judiciously! aSymbol is ussually a class name (starting with uppercase) or a protocolo conformance question (starting with lowercase), such as #hasTextSelector, #hasTextProvider, etc. A few comments: - Good for kernel tests - Good for tests defined in the same package as the receiver - Overwriting this method in a different package is a bad idea. It will surely conflict with other package. Use the traditional isXXX in such cases - In any case, asking these kinds of questions is a sign of poor design. If possible, avoid the question altogether, using, for example, double dispatching. - if a class happens to answer true for several Symbols, consider implementing it like: ^#(symbol1 symbol2 symbol3) statePointsTo: aSymbol

## Text

I represent a character string that has been marked with abstract changes in character appearance. Text associates a set of TextAttributes with each character in its character string. These attributes may be fonts, emphases such as bold or italic, or hyperling actions. Since most characters have the same attributes as their neighbors, the attributes are stored in a RunArray for efficiency. Each of my instances has string a String runs a RunArray From the comment at #deepCopy, written by Dan on 11/9/97: "Both string and runs are assumed to be read-only"

#### TextModel>>#is: aSymbol

A means for cleanly replacing isXXX like methods. Please use judiciously! aSymbol is ussually a class name (starting with uppercase) or a protocolo conformance question (starting with lowercase), such as #hasTextSelector, #hasTextProvider, etc. A few comments: - Good for kernel tests - Good for tests defined in the same package as the receiver - Overwriting this method in a different package is a bad idea. It will surely conflict with other package. Use the traditional isXXX in such cases - In any case, asking these kinds of questions is a sign of poor design. If possible, avoid the question altogether, using, for example, double dispatching. - if a class happens to answer true for several Symbols, consider implementing it like: ^#(symbol1 symbol2 symbol3) statePointsTo: aSymbol

## Trie

I am an efficient collection of Strings. I behave a bit like a Dictionary, with the restriction that keys are instances of String. Notes: - check for inclusion is extremely fast - iteration is always done in collation order, contents are always sorted without performance cost - Behaves both like a Set (#add:, #remove:, #includes, #do) and a Dictionary (#at:put:, #at:, #at:ifAbsent:) | t | t _ Trie new. t add: 'car'. t at: 'car' put: Float pi. t at: 'cat' put: Date today. t explore. (t includesKey: 'car') print. (t includes: 'cat') print | t | t _ Trie new. Smalltalk allImplementedMessages do: [ :s | t add: s ]. t explore

## Workspace

A Workspace is a text area plus a lot of support for executable code. It is a great place to execute top-level commands to compute something useful, and it is a great place to develop bits of a program before those bits get put into class methods. To open a new workspace, execute: Workspace openLabel: 'a workspace' A workspace can have its own variables, called "workspace variables", to hold intermediate results. For example, if you type into a workspace "x := 5" and do-it, then later you could type in "y := x * 2" and y would become 10. Additionally, in Morphic, a workspace can gain access to morphs that are on the screen. If acceptDroppedMorphss is turned on, then whenever a morph is dropped on the workspace, a variable will be created which references that morph. This functionality is toggled with the window-wide menu of a workspace.

#### Workspace>>#is: aSymbol

A means for cleanly replacing isXXX like methods. Please use judiciously! aSymbol is ussually a class name (starting with uppercase) or a protocolo conformance question (starting with lowercase), such as #hasTextSelector, #hasTextProvider, etc. A few comments: - Good for kernel tests - Good for tests defined in the same package as the receiver - Overwriting this method in a different package is a bad idea. It will surely conflict with other package. Use the traditional isXXX in such cases - In any case, asking these kinds of questions is a sign of poor design. If possible, avoid the question altogether, using, for example, double dispatching. - if a class happens to answer true for several Symbols, consider implementing it like: ^#(symbol1 symbol2 symbol3) statePointsTo: aSymbol
