## About Cuis

Cuis is an Open Source, multiplatform [Smalltalk-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) system.

Cuis is
* Small
* Clean
* Appropriable

Additionally, Cuis is:
* Open Source
* Multiplatform

Like other Smalltalk systems, Cuis is also:
* A complete development environment written in itself
* A pure, dynamic Object Oriented language

Cuis assumes very little on the underlying platform, and this lets it run out-of-the-box on Windows, MacOS, Linux, ChromeOS and WebBrowsers. Cuis shares the [OpenSmalltalk Virtual Machine](http://www.opensmalltalk.org) with Squeak, Pharo and Newspeak.
